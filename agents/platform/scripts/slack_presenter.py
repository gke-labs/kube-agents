"""Slack presentation for kube-agents: answer layout, buttons and reactions.

Pure functions only. Nothing here imports the Hermes gateway, the Slack SDK or
the network, so any process that posts to Slack can use it, and it can move
with Slack ingress when it leaves the gateway. Its callers include the
gateway patches for reactions (``slack_ux_reactions``, which the kanban
notifier also reaches), incident triage (``slack_ux_incident``) and button
clicks (``slack_ux_clicks``).
Every caller reaches it through ``PYTHONPATH=/opt/defaults/scripts``, which the
operator sets on the agent container.

Everything a caller changes on screen is gated on :func:`enabled`, the
``KAGE_SLACK_UX`` environment variable, off by default. With it off, callers
take their upstream path unchanged; this module only answers questions.

Layout: :func:`split_answer` takes the headline off an agent's markdown
answer; url link buttons and choice buttons, whose value is the label, are
built by ``_button`` and wrapped into rows by ``_actions``; :func:`fallback_text`
is the headline, links and choices as plain mrkdwn, for the message's ``text``
field.

Reactions (:func:`arrival_reaction`, :func:`settle_reaction`): the first
reaction says what kind of ask arrived, chosen by keyword before any model
call; a second joins it when the work settles. The first is never removed; the
credential proxy refuses every Slack method ending in ``remove``.
