"""Answer clicks on kube-agents' own Slack buttons.

Installed into the image at ``/opt/hermes/gateway/slack_ux_clicks.py``.
``apply_slack_ux_clicks.py`` makes the Slack adapter call :func:`register`
when it wires its Bolt listeners, only when ``KAGE_SLACK_UX`` is on. With the
flag off nothing here is registered and the adapter's listeners are upstream's.

Upstream, and why it changes
----------------------------
Hermes handles clicks on its own buttons (approvals, clarify, the model
picker) and on buttons a plugin registered. Nothing handles the buttons
``slack_presenter`` lays out, so Slack delivers the ``block_actions`` and the
click does nothing.

With the flag on, :func:`register` adds two listeners:

* A choice button (``<prefix>.choice.<n>``) is the clicker answering in the
  thread with the button's text as Slack showed it. Never its ``value``: the
  presenter clips the text to Slack's 75 characters but keeps up to 2000 in
  the value, and a click must not send words the clicker did not see. A
  label that starts like a command (``/`` or ``!``) is sent as text, since a
  choice is an answer. The click goes through the adapter's own interactive
  authorization; an unlisted user's click is logged and changes nothing, and
  so does one in a channel or DM the adapter would ignore a typed message in.
  Then the message is rewritten with the choice buttons replaced by
  a line naming who chose what, a short echo ("↳ @user: label") is posted in
  the thread, since a bot token cannot post as the user, and the label is fed
  to the adapter's message handler as that user's message in that thread, the
  path a reaction trigger already takes. That path applies the channel and user checks a typed message gets, so a click
  can do nothing its clicker could not do by typing the label.
* A link button (``<prefix>.link.<n>``) is acknowledged and nothing else;
  Slack has already opened the url.

A message is answered once: the first authorized click wins, and a second
click on the same message, before the rewrite lands, is dropped in this
process and logged. If the rewrite fails, the buttons stay on the message but
the click still counts: its turn runs, so a later click on them is dropped and
logged rather than running a second apply.

Fail-soft throughout: a rewrite or echo that fails is logged and the turn
still runs, because the click was the user's answer.
